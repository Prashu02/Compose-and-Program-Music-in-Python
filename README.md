EarSketch is a DAW (Digital Audio Workstation) that allows users to create music using Python. 
It has built-in sound clips made by professionals in the music industry for users to mix and combine into novel musical compositions.
Instead of providing a GUI interface for users (such as Garageband from Apple), 
Earsketch provides an IDE (integrated development environment) 
where users can write Python code to create music,EarSketch runs in a web browser without installing any additional software.
